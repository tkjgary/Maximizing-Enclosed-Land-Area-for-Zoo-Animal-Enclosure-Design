# Maximizing-Enclosed-Land-Area-for-Zoo-Animal-Enclosure-Design
This project focuses on designing a temporary animal enclosure in a zoo with the goal of maximizing the enclosed area using a fixed length of barrier. The proposed design consists of a semicircular section with a radius, ùëü connected to a rectangular section with a length ‚Ñé and no width, as illustrated in [[Figure 1](#figure1)]. Together, these shapes form an enclosed area surrounded by a barrier of limited length.

The enclosure is intended for animals that thrive in open, naturalistic environments, but the available barrier length is restricted to 1000 meters. As a result, this project aims to determine the optimal dimensions of ùëü and ‚Ñé that maximize the enclosed area while adhering to the barrier length constraint.

## Methodology
The optimization process is done by using the octave software. To determine the best 
combinations of r and h, the value of r is first fixed at a constant value. The enclosed land 
area is then computed and plotted against a range of values of h. The reverse is also carried 
out, where the enclosed land area is plotted against a range of values of r using fixed values 
of h. Different values of h are used in the plot to determine the dependency of h on r and also 
on the enclosed land area. 

A 3-dimensional surface plot is constructed from three variables, h, r and enclosed land area 
on separate axis. The independent variables, h and r are plotted on the horizontal axis while 
the dependent area is plotted on the vertical axis. This is to display the functional relationship 
between each independent variables, h and r with the designated dependent variable, the 
enclosed land area. The optimum combination between two sets of data, h and r can also be 
determined. A contour plot is also used to display a series of lines of constant land area. 
Besides showing the change of enclosed land area as a function of h and r, this plot also 
shows the impact of each dimension, h and r on the enclosed land area.

Lastly, the enclosed land area is plotted against the dimension r by fixing the value of the 
length of the fence. Since the length limits the value of r and h, this graph is used to show the 
effect of increasing one dimension, r while decreasing the other, h on the enclosed land area. 
The program is also written to display the value of the maximum enclosed land area and the 
dimension h and r that correspond to the maximum enclosed land area, which determines the 
optimum dimensions for the fence. Additionally, the enclosed land area is plotted against the 
length of the fence to determine the contribution of the length of the fence on the enclosed 
land area.
