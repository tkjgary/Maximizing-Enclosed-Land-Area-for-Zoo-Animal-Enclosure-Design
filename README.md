# Maximizing-Enclosed-Land-Area-for-Zoo-Animal-Enclosure-Design
This project focuses on designing a temporary animal enclosure in a zoo with the goal of maximizing the enclosed area using a fixed length of barrier. The proposed design consists of a semicircular section with a radius, ùëü connected to a rectangular section with a length ‚Ñé and no width, as illustrated in [Figure 1]. Together, these shapes form an enclosed area surrounded by a barrier of limited length.

The enclosure is intended for animals that thrive in open, naturalistic environments, but the available barrier length is restricted to 1000 meters. As a result, this project aims to determine the optimal dimensions of ùëü and ‚Ñé that maximize the enclosed area while adhering to the barrier length constraint.
